    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oatmeal is one of my favorite breakfast foods. It is quick to prepare and easily adaptable to my ever-changing
        moods—some days I want it with fruit, some days I want it plain, and sometimes I want a little bit of everything
        in it (that’s when I include all of the optional ingredients listed here!). This basic recipe is all you need to
        get started … add as much or as little of the extras as you like.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Pinch of sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh berries (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 ripe banana, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped nuts, such as walnuts, pecans, or cashews (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried fruit, such as raisins, cranberries, chopped apples, chopped</li>
        <li>Apricots (optional)</li>
        <li>Maple syrup (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Top with the berries, banana, nuts, and/or dried fruit, as you like.</li>
        <li>If desired, pour a little maple syrup on top. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
