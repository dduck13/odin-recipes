    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>12 oz of spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>PREPARING CHICKEN BREASTS: Make sure to cut chicken breasts horizontally to make them thin. Paper towel dry the chicken. </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Stir well to blend.
            Using a fork or tongs, coat the chicken breasts in the flour mixture by pressing into the mixture with tongs
            and then flipping the chicken over to coat the other side. Set aside.</li>
        <li>COOKING CHICKEN BREASTS: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the
            skillet is hot, place flour coated chicken breasts in the skillet and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side,
            until golden brown on both sides and cooked through, turning once between cooking, about 8-10 minutes.
            Remove chicken from pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>SAUCE: Add butter, diced yellow onion and minced garlic cloves to pan. Cook on medium high until onions and
            garlic are translucent, about 2 minutes. Next add chopped scallions and tomatoes. Add 1 tablespoon flour to
            pan and whisk to combine. </li>
        <li>Now add heavy cream, wine, Italian Seasoning, salt and red pepper flakes. Bring mixture to a simmering point
            and then add Â½ cup of shredded Parmesan cheese. Use a whisk or a wooden spoon and mix it in until you have a
            smooth mixture.</li>
        <li>COOKING PASTA according to your package instructions in salty water. I like pasta that is neither too hard
            nor too soft, so I always cook it Al Dente. Drain, but do not rinse.</li>
        <li>FINAL ASSEMBLY: Add cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce and stir to combine on low heat for 2-4
            minutes. Taste and add salt, if needed. Return chicken to skillet on top of the pasta and allow it to warm
            up for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>SERVE chicken either on top or next to pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
